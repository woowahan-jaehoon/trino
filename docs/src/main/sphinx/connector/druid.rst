Druid connector
===============

The Druid connector allows querying an `Apache Druid <https://druid.apache.org/>`_
database from Trino.

Requirements
------------

To connect to Druid, you need:

* Druid version 0.18.0 or higher.
* Network access from the Trino coordinator and workers to your Druid broker.
  Port 8082 is the default port.

Configuration
-------------

Create a catalog properties file that specifies the Druid connector by setting
the ``connector.name`` to ``druid`` and configuring the ``connection-url`` with
the JDBC string to connect to Druid.

For example, to access a database as ``druid``, create the file
``etc/catalog/druid.properties``. Replace ``BROKER:8082`` with the correct
host and port of your Druid broker.

.. code-block:: properties

    connector.name=druid
    connection-url=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://BROKER:8082/druid/v2/sql/avatica/

You can add authentication details to connect to a Druid deployment that is
secured by basic authentication by updating the URL and adding credentials:

.. code-block:: properties

    connection-url=jdbc:avatica:remote:url=http://BROKER:port/druid/v2/sql/avatica/;authentication=BASIC
    connection-user=root
    connection-password=secret

Now you can access your Druid database in Trino with the ``druiddb`` catalog
name from the properties file.

.. include:: jdbc-procedures.fragment

.. include:: jdbc-case-insensitive-matching.fragment

.. _druid-type-mapping:

Type mapping
------------

.. include:: jdbc-type-mapping.fragment

.. _druid-sql-support:

SQL support
-----------

The connector provides :ref:`globally available <sql-globally-available>` and
:ref:`read operation <sql-read-operations>` statements to access data and
metadata in the Druid database.
