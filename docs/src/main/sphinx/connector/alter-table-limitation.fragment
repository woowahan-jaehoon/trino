ALTER TABLE
^^^^^^^^^^^

The connector does not support renaming tables across multiple schemas. For
example, the following statement is supported:

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER TABLE catalog.schema_one.table_one RENAME TO catalog.schema_one.table_two

The following statement attempts to rename a table across schemas, and therefore
is not supported:

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER TABLE catalog.schema_one.table_one RENAME TO catalog.schema_two.table_two
